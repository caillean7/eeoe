Enhanced Elixir of Exploration
v1
======================

As an additional reward and motivation to complete the Seeking your Roots quest you will receive a special version of the Elixir of Exploration from Sinderion when delivering Nirnroot to him. The Enhanced Elixir of Exploration will boost your luck attribute by 1, 2, 3 or respectively 5 points permanently when consumed.

This is only the case for the first free samples you get, the other potions you can buy from Sinderion are unchanged. So altogether you can get additional 11 points of luck out of the quest now. The Enhanced Elixirs of Exploration are more valuable than the ordinary elixir, so if you don't want to use them, you can still sell them.

If you think the attribute raise too meager please feel free to make your own modifications. Have fun!
